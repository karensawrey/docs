# Mattermost


If you're using open-source [Mattermost messenger](https://mattermost.com/) you can receive notifications about your builds in your Mattermost workspace. The process of setting up the Buildkite integration with Mattermost is very similar to setting up the [integration with Slack](/docs/integrations/slack) messenger.

Configuring a Mattermost notification service will authorize access for your desired channel. By default, notifications will be sent to all configured Mattermost channels.

Setting up a Notification Service requires Buildkite organization admin access. 

## Adding a notification service  

In your [Organizationâ€™s Notification Settings](https://buildkite.com/organizations/-/services), add a Slack notification service.

Click the 'Add to Slack' button:

Select to manually specify a Webhook URL.

Specify the following information: 
1. Description of your Mattermost notification
1. Your Mattermost webhook URL
1. Message theme (text or emoji)
1. Pipelines (all or only some)  
1. Branches that will trigger a notification
1. Build state filtering (by default - 'Only send notifications for failed and fixed builds')

If you're using the [`notify` YAML attribute](/docs/pipelines/notifications) for more fine-grained control over your Mattermost notifications, select the 'Only Some Pipelines...' option. Once you're using a Slack `notify` attribute in your `pipeline.yml`, the branch and build filtering from the Mattermost Notification Service will be overridden by the YAML options you choose.

```
notify:
- slack: "#ci"
```  

## Changing channels

Once created, the channel and workspace in Mattermost cannot be changed. To post to a different channel or workspace, create a new notification service.

## Conditional notifications

By default, notifications are sent to all configured Mattermost channels. For more control over when each channel receives notifications, use the [`notify` YAML attribute](/docs/pipelines/notifications) in your `pipeline.yml` file.

See the [Slack Channel Message](/docs/pipelines/notifications) section of the Notifications guide for more information.


## Create a new Mattermost notification service

Using the instructions above, [add a new Mattermost notification service](/docs/integrations/mattermost#adding-a-notification-service) with the same settings as the existing integration.
